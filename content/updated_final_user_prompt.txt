Superconnec- tors who rate the Bellagio well become our proxy for estimating which restaurants might catch the eye of new types of target visitors. Now that we have helped the Bellagio reach new groups, we're going to see how we can use community detection to further improve our app. Finding Similar Categories While our end users are using the app to find hotels, we want to showcase other busi- nesses they might be interested in.

Summary Centrality algorithms are an excellent tool for identifying influencers in a network. In this chapter weve learned about the prototypical centrality algorithms: Degree Cen- trality, Closeness Centrality, Betweenness Centrality, and PageRank. We've also cov- ered several variations to deal with issues such as long runtimes and isolated c  Interestingly, the authors found extracting connected features from multiple types of relationships even more predictive than simply adding more fea- tures. The Report Subgraph section shows how graph features are converted into fea- tures that the ML model can use. By combining multiple methods in a graph- enhanced ML workflow, the authors were able to improve prior detection methods and classify 70% of spammers that had previously required manual labeling, with 90% accuracy. Even once we have extracted connected features, we can improve our training by using graph algorithms like PageRank to prioritize the features with the most influ- ence. This enables us to adequately represent our data while eliminating noisy vari- ables that could degrade results or slow processing. With this type of information, we can also identify features with high co-occurrence for further model tuning via fea- ture reduction. This method is outlined in the research paper Using PageRank in Feature Selection, by D. Ienco, R. Meo, and M. Botta. on Experiment in Social Influence and Political Mobiliza- tion, by R. Bond et al. 184 | Chapter 8: Using Graph Algorithms to Enhance Machine Learning Friends Voting Friends of Friends Voting \Voted" IVoted" \Voted" Button Button Button 60M Facebook Users Added 886K Votes Added 1M Votes Figure 8-1. People are influenced to vote by their social networks. In this example, friends two hops away had more total impact than direct relationships. The authors found that friends reporting voting influenced an additional 1.4% of users to also claim theyd voted and, interestingly, friends of friends added another 1.7%. Small percentages can have a significant impact, and we can see in Figure 8-1 that people at two hops out had in total more impact than the direct friends alone. Voting and other examples of how our social networks impact us are covered in the book Connected, by Nicholas Christakis and James Fowler (Little, Brown and Com- pany). Adding graph features and context improves predictions, especially in situations where connections   It also reveals the connections between these individuals with their respective followers. Specifically, Michael has followers in James, Bridget, and Alice, while Charles has followers in Amy and David. The number of followers for each individual is represented by a numerical value. The image presents a stylized, orange scorpion silhouette within a reddish-orange square frame. The scorpion is positioned diagonally, with its tail curving upwards and its body angled downwards. The frame has a simple, geometric design. The scorpion's body is segmented, and its legs are spread apart. The overall impression is a simple, graphic representation of a scorpion. The visualization shows the relationships between several individuals, including Michael, James, Charles, Bridget, David, Amy, Mark, and Alice. It also shows the connections between these individuals with their respective followings. Specifically, there are two instances of 'Follows' and 'Follower' connections.

Connected feature extraction can be combined with other predictive methods to improve results. AUPR refers to the area under the precision-recall curve, with higher numbers preferred. We've discussed how connected features are applied to scenarios involving fraud and spammer detection. In these situations, activities are often hidden in multiple layers of obfuscation and network relationships. Traditional feature extraction and selection methods may be unable to detect that behavior without the contextual information that graphs bring. ir customer base by attracting new guests from different types of communities as a greenfield opportu- nity. We can use the Betweenness Centrality algorithm that we discussed earlier to work out which Bellagio reviewers are not only well connected across the whole Yelp network, but might also act as a bridge between different groups.

This algorithm calculates a betweenness score by sampling nodes and only exploring shortest paths to a certain depth. After some experimentation, we improved results with a few parameters set differ- ently than the default values. We'll use shortest paths of up to 4 hops (maxDepth of 4) and sample 20% of the nodes (pr  The squirrel is positioned facing right, with its tail curled upwards.

Per- haps we need to look at new areas and see what happens when we add community information. Predicting Links: Community Detection We hypothesize that nodes that are in the same community are more likely to have a link between them if they dont already. Moreover, we believe that the tighter a com- munity is, the more likely links are. First, we'll compute more coarse-grained communities using the Label Propagation algorithm in Neo4j.

Representative community detection algorithms We use the terms set, partition, cluster, group, and community inter- changeably. These terms are different ways to indicate that similar nodes can be grouped. Community detection algorithms are also called clustering and partitioning algorithms. In each section, we use the terms that are most prominent in the literature for a partic- ular algorithm. 110 | Chapter 6: Community Detection Algorithms Table 6-1.

The distribution appears to be somewhat balanced, with a concentration of players in the top leagues. There are also notable outliers, such as Doncaster and London, which have a significant number of players. The diagram shows three different cycles: Eulerian Cycle, Hamiltonian Cycle, and Eulerian and Hamiltonian. The Eulerian Cycle is a cycle where every node in the graph is visited once. The Hamiltonian Cycle is a cycle where every node is visited twice. The Eulerian and Hamiltonian Cycle is a cycle where every node is visited three times.
